# Customer Use Case Specification (Implemented Scope)

Date: 2025-10-09  
Version: 1.0  
Actor Focus: Customer (registered user). Guest flows only included where they overlap registration/login.

## 1. Scope & Truthfulness
Covers only features implemented in the application backend & frontend:
- Account registration & authentication (JWT based).
- Product browsing, category filter, name search, product detail viewing.
- Shopping cart management (add, update quantity, remove, view cart).
- Checkout to create an order (assuming immediate success; no external payment gateway integration included yet).
- Viewing list of own orders and individual order details.
- Logout (client-side token removal).

Not Included: Wishlists, reviews/ratings, external payment capture, refunds, returns, address management, discount codes, order cancellation by customer (unless implemented later).

## 2. Actors
- **Customer**: Registered user performing shopping actions.
- **System (Backend API)**: Authentication, product, cart (implicit client-managed), and order services.

## 3. Implemented Customer Use Cases
| ID | Use Case | Description |
|----|----------|-------------|
| UC-CUST-01 | Register Account | Create a new customer account with credentials. |
| UC-CUST-02 | Authenticate (Login) | Obtain JWT for subsequent authorized actions. |
| UC-CUST-03 | Browse Products | View paginated/complete active product list. |
| UC-CUST-04 | Filter by Category | Narrow product list by chosen category. |
| UC-CUST-05 | Search Products | Search products by name substring. |
| UC-CUST-06 | View Product Detail | See detailed info for a single product. |

| UC-CUST-08 | Update Cart Item Quantity | Change quantity of product already in cart. |
| UC-CUST-09 | Remove Cart Item | Remove a product line from cart. |
| UC-CUST-10 | View Cart | Display current cart contents & totals (client). |
| UC-CUST-11 | Checkout Order | Submit cart to create order (with stock & total validation). |
| UC-CUST-12 | View My Orders | Retrieve list of customerâ€™s own orders. |
| UC-CUST-13 | View Order Detail | Retrieve details (lines, totals, status) for a specific order. |
| UC-CUST-14 | Logout | Clear local session token. |

## 7. Non-Functional Notes
- Fast product queries rely on indexes (category, name substring if supported).
- JWT token expiry requires re-authentication.

## 8. Excluded / Future (Not Implemented)
- Payment gateway integration (external authorization).
- Order cancellation by customer.
- Saved addresses & profile management.
- Promotions, coupons, or loyalty points.
- Product reviews & ratings.

# Use Case Specification (Admin, Cashier, Customer)

Date: 2025-10-09  
Version: 1.0  
Scope: Core operational features for Admin, Cashier (POS), and Registered Customer roles. Guest-only browsing use cases are excluded unless they overlap with registered customer flows.

---
## 1. Actors
- **Admin**: Manages catalog, categories, users, orders, system configuration.
- **Cashier**: Operates POS, processes in‑store sales, reprints receipts, reviews POS transactions.
- **Customer**: Registered end-user; browses products, manages cart, places and tracks orders.
- **Payment Gateway (External System)**: Handles payment authorization (placeholder / future integration).
- **Inventory System (Internal Service / DB)**: Maintains stock counts (JPA entities & transactional logic).

## 5. Conversion to .docx or .doc
A direct modern format is .docx. Use Pandoc locally (recommended). From repository root run:

```powershell
# Ensure pandoc is installed (winget or choco examples):
winget install --id=Pandoc.Pandoc -e --source=winget
# Convert to DOCX
pandoc .\docs\USE_CASE_SPEC.md -o .\docs\USE_CASE_SPEC.docx --metadata title="Use Case Specification"
# (Optional) Also generate PDF if LaTeX installed
pandoc .\docs\USE_CASE_SPEC.md -o .\docs\USE_CASE_SPEC.pdf
```

Legacy .doc format is not recommended; if absolutely required, open the generated .docx in Word and "Save As" .doc.

## 6. Future Enhancements
- Add sequence diagrams for POS sale & checkout payment.
- Integrate audit logging use case (Admin security oversight).
- Add guest browsing + wishlist use cases.
- Internationalization and multi-currency pricing rules.

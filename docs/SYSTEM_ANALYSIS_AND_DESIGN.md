# System Analysis & Design Documentation

## 1. Overview
This document captures the functional analysis of the DVP Gift Center system covering Customer web storefront, Cashier POS, and Admin back‑office capabilities. It includes: actors, use case diagram, comprehensive use case list & scenarios, activity diagrams, and a domain class diagram.

## 2. Actors
Primary Actors:
- **Guest** – Unauthenticated visitor who can browse and search products, then register/login.
- **Customer** – Authenticated user purchasing via the online storefront.
- **Cashier** – In‑store staff operating the POS to process walk‑in or registered customer sales.
- **Admin** – Manages products, categories, inventory, availability, transactions, and orders.
- **Payment Processor** (external conceptual) – Represents payment capture (currently internal simulation).
- **Email Service** (conceptual) – Future integration for order confirmation notifications.

Secondary/Internal Actors:
- **Authentication Service** – Issues and validates JWT tokens.
- **Inventory System** – Internal responsibility for up-to-date stock levels and movements.

## 8. Traceability Matrix (Use Cases → Classes)
| Use Case | Key Classes |
|----------|-------------|
| Checkout Online Order | CartItem, Product, Inventory, Transaction, TransactionItem, Payment, StockMovement, User |
| Process POS Sale | Product, Inventory, Transaction, TransactionItem, Payment, StockMovement, User |
| Manage Products | Product, Category |
| Soft Delete / Restore | Product |
| Adjust Stock | Inventory, StockMovement, Product |
| View POS Bills | Transaction, TransactionItem, Payment |
| View My Orders | Transaction, TransactionItem, Payment |
| Print POS Receipt | Transaction, TransactionItem, Payment |
| Browse/Search Products | Product, Category |

## 9. Non-Functional Considerations
- **Security:** JWT + role-based access (ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_CASHIER, ROLE_CUSTOMER).
- **Consistency:** Inventory and stock movements updated atomically in transaction boundary.
- **Auditability:** StockMovement retains before/after counts.
- **Extensibility:** Walk-in customers supported with nullable customer in `Transaction`.
- **Performance:** Simple queries; indexes recommended on `bill_number`, `barcode`, `product_code`.

## 10. Future Enhancements
- External payment gateway integration.
- Email/SMS notification service.
- Reporting dashboards (low stock, daily sales KPIs).
- Customer loyalty / discount engine.
- Batch import/export for products and inventory.

## Customer Endpoints (JWT required)

Checkout

  - Persists totals to transactions: total_amount, tax_amount, net_amount.
  - Returns order info and computed totals.
  - Request body (example):
    {
      "items": [{ "productId": 1, "quantity": 2, "price": 50.00 }],
      "shippingAddress": "string",
      "paymentMethod": "CREDIT_CARD",
      "totalAmount": 108.50
    }

## Common Patterns

Pagination (when available)
- Use page, size, sort, direction query params
- Example: GET /online/products?page=0&size=20&sort=name&direction=asc

Validation highlights
- Product: name required; price positive; category valid
- Checkout: at least 1 item; shipping address required; totals are recomputed on server

Security
- Public: /online/products/**, /online/categories/**, /auth/**, Swagger if enabled
- Customer: /online/cart/**, /online/checkout/**, /online/orders/**
- Admin: /admin/**

Currency & Tax
- Currency is LKR sitewide.
- Tax rate is managed globally. Default from `app.tax.rate`; admin updates stored in `uploads/config/tax-config.json`. Public read via `/settings/tax`.

Identifiers
- Bill Number Format: `DVP{yyMMdd}{userId}{HHmmss}` with collision fallback.
- Payment Reference Format: `REF-{METHOD}{yyMMddHHmmss}{NNNN}` where METHOD is one of CASH, COD, DC, CC. Server validates uniqueness.
